To interact with Bybit’s API for trading functions and order placement in a **contract account** (focused on derivatives like USDT Perpetual, USDC Perpetual, Inverse Futures, or Options), you can use Bybit’s V5 API, which unifies Spot, Derivatives, and Options trading under a single set of specifications. Below is a detailed guide on the key trading functions and order placement process for a contract account using Bybit’s API, based on the provided context and general knowledge of Bybit’s API.

---

### **1. Overview of Bybit API for Contract Accounts**
Bybit’s V5 API provides a streamlined interface for trading derivatives, including USDT Perpetual, USDC Perpetual, Inverse Futures, and Options, under a Unified Trading Account (UTA). Key features include:
- **Unified API**: A single API for Spot, Derivatives, and Options, distinguished by the `category` parameter (e.g., `linear` for USDT/USDC Perpetuals, `inverse` for Inverse Futures, `option` for Options).
- **REST API**: For HTTP requests to place, manage, and query orders, positions, and account details.
- **WebSocket API**: For real-time market data and order execution, including the recently introduced WebSocket order placement feature (announced April 30, 2024).[](https://announcements.bybit.com/article/introducing-new-api-feature-websocket-order-placement-blt9d3dc36eff27f1c1/)
- **Rate Limits**: Bybit enforces rate limits to ensure system stability. Exceeding these may result in temporary IP restrictions. You can request a higher limit via your client manager.[](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order)[](https://wundertrading.com/journal/en/learn/article/bybit-api)
- **Authentication**: Requires API key and secret for secure access. You can create these on Bybit’s platform (mainnet or testnet).[](https://learn.bybit.com/en/bybit-guide/how-to-create-a-bybit-api-key)

For contract accounts, the API supports trading functionalities like order placement, position management, account balance queries, and more, with specific endpoints tailored for derivatives.

---

### **3. Order Placement for Contract Accounts**
To place an order in a contract account using the Bybit V5 API, you primarily use the `/v5/order/create` endpoint or the WebSocket order placement feature. Below is a step-by-step guide for placing orders, including examples.

#### **Key Parameters for Order Placement**
When placing an order, you need to specify the following parameters (as per the `/v5/order/create` endpoint documentation):[](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order)
- **category**: Specifies the contract type (`linear` for USDT/USDC Perpetuals, `inverse` for Inverse Futures, `option` for Options).
- **symbol**: The trading pair (e.g., `BTCUSDT` for linear, `BTCUSD` for inverse).
- **side**: `Buy` or `Sell`.
- **orderType**: `Market` (executes at the best available price) or `Limit` (executes at a specified price).
- **qty**: The quantity of contracts to buy/sell (e.g., `0.001` BTC for linear contracts, `100` USD for inverse contracts).
- **price**: Required for Limit orders; optional for Market orders.
- **timeInForce**: Specifies order execution strategy:
  - `GTC` (Good Till Cancel): Order remains active until filled or canceled.
  - `IOC` (Immediate or Cancel): Fills immediately or cancels unfilled portions.
  - `FOK` (Fill or Kill): Fills entirely or cancels.
  - `PostOnly`: Ensures the order adds liquidity (canceled if it would be filled immediately).[](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order)[](https://www.codearmo.com/python-tutorial/placing-orders-bybit-python)
- **orderLinkId**: A custom order ID (up to 36 characters, must be unique) for tracking. The system also generates a unique `orderId`.[](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order)
- **takeProfit/stopLoss**: Optional parameters to set TP/SL at order placement.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69184604/bybit-api-is-there-a-way-to-place-take-profit-stop-loss-orders-after-a-openin)[](https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Introduction-to-Take-Profit-Stop-Loss-Perpetual-Futures-Contracts/)
- **positionIdx**: Used for hedged positions (e.g., `0` for one-way mode, `1` for buy-side hedged, `2` for sell-side hedged).[](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order)

#### **Order Limits**
- **Perpetuals & Futures**: Maximum of 500 active orders per symbol, 10 conditional orders per symbol.[](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order)
- **Order Quantity**: Must be a positive number and meet the minimum order size (check `/v5/market/instruments-info` for `minOrderQty`).[](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order)[](https://www.codearmo.com/python-tutorial/placing-orders-bybit-python)
- **Price Limits**: For Limit orders, the price must be higher than the liquidation price if holding a position. Check `tickSize` in `/v5/market/instruments-info`.[](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order)
- **Order Cost**: Includes initial margin, open/close fees, and depends on leverage and fee rates. For USDT/USDC contracts, costs are paid in USDT/USDC; for inverse contracts, costs are paid in the respective coin (e.g., BTC for BTCUSD).[](https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Order-Cost-USDT-Contract)

#### **Example: Placing a Limit Order (REST API)**
Below is a JavaScript example using the `bybit-api` library to place a Limit order for a USDT Perpetual contract (`linear` category):

```javascript
const { RestClientV5 } = require('bybit-api');

const client = new RestClientV5({
  testnet: true, // Use testnet for testing
  key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  secret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET',
});

client
  .submitOrder({
    category: 'linear', // USDT Perpetual
    symbol: 'BTCUSDT',
    side: 'Buy',
    orderType: 'Limit',
    qty: '0.001', // Quantity in BTC
    price: '50000', // Limit price
    timeInForce: 'GTC',
    orderLinkId: 'my-order-001', // Custom order ID
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log('Limit order result:', response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Limit order error:', error);
  });
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "retCode": 0,
  "retMsg": "OK",
  "result": {
    "orderId": "1321003749386327552",
    "orderLinkId": "my-order-001"
  },
  "retExtInfo": {},
  "time": 1672211918471
}
```

#### **Example: Placing a Market Order (REST API)**
```javascript
client
  .submitOrder({
    category: 'linear',
    symbol: 'BTCUSDT',
    side: 'Buy',
    orderType: 'Market',
    qty: '0.001',
    timeInForce: 'IOC', // Immediate or Cancel
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log('Market order result:', response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Market order error:', error);
  });
```

#### **Example: Placing an Order with TP/SL**
To set Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) at order placement:
```javascript
client
  .submitOrder({
    category: 'linear',
    symbol: 'BTCUSDT',
    side: 'Buy',
    orderType: 'Limit',
    qty: '0.001',
    price: '50000',
    timeInForce: 'GTC',
    takeProfit: '55000', // TP price
    stopLoss: '45000', // SL price
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log('Order with TP/SL result:', response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

#### **Example: WebSocket Order Placement**
For faster execution, use WebSocket order placement (available since April 30, 2024). Below is a Go example using the `bybit-go-api` SDK:[](https://announcements.bybit.com/article/introducing-new-api-feature-websocket-order-placement-blt9d3dc36eff27f1c1/)[](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/bybit.go.api/blob/main/README.md)
```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
  "github.com/bybit-exchange/bybit.go.api"
)

func main() {
  ws := bybit.NewBybitPrivateWebSocket(
    "wss://stream-testnet.bybit.com/v5/private",
    "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "YOUR_API_SECRET",
    func(message string) error {
      fmt.Println("Received:", message)
      return nil
    },
  )

  _, _ = ws.Connect().SendTradeRequest(map[string]interface{}{
    "reqId": "test-005",
    "header": map[string]string{
      "X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP": fmt.Sprintf("%d", time.Now().UnixMilli()),
      "X-BAPI-RECV-WINDOW": "8000",
    },
    "op": "order.create",
    "args": []interface{}{
      map[string]interface{}{
        "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
        "side": "Buy",
        "orderType": "Limit",
        "qty": "0.001",
        "price": "50000",
        "category": "linear",
        "timeInForce": "GTC",
      },
    },
  })

  select {} // Keep the program running
}
```

#### **Adding TP/SL After Position**
To add TP/SL after opening a position, use the `/v5/order/create` endpoint with `reduceOnly=true` and specify `takeProfit` or `stopLoss`. Example:
```javascript
client
  .submitOrder({
    category: 'linear',
    symbol: 'BTCUSDT',
    side: 'Sell', // Opposite side to close a long position
    orderType: 'Limit',
    qty: '0.001',
    price: '55000', // TP price
    reduceOnly: true,
    timeInForce: 'GTC',
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log('TP order result:', response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

Alternatively, subscribe to the WebSocket `execution` topic to monitor trade executions and place TP/SL orders programmatically when a position is filled.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69184604/bybit-api-is-there-a-way-to-place-take-profit-stop-loss-orders-after-a-openin)

---

### **4. Advanced Order Types**
Bybit supports advanced order types for contract accounts:
- **Conditional Orders**: Trigger Market or Limit orders when a specific price is reached (e.g., Stop-Entry, TP, SL).[](https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Types-of-Orders-Available-on-Bybit)
- **Trailing Stop**: Adjusts the stop price dynamically based on market movements (e.g., retracement of $1,000 or 10%). Available for UTA users in Spot and Derivatives trading.[](https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Trailing-Stop-Order-Perpetual-and-Futures-Trading)
- **Iceberg Orders**: Splits large orders into smaller sub-orders to minimize market impact and slippage.[](https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Types-of-Orders-Available-on-Bybit)
- **Quick Trading Functions**: Includes Quick Open (Market/Limit), Quick Close, and Quick Reverse for rapid position management. These are primarily for UI but can be emulated via API.[](https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Quick-trading-functions)

---

### **5. Best Practices**
- **Testnet**: Use Bybit’s testnet (`https://api-testnet.bybit.com`) for testing to avoid real funds. Create a testnet account and API keys at `https://testnet.bybit.com`.[](https://www.bybit.com/future-activity/en/developer)[](https://medium.com/%40alvinmutebi/how-to-place-a-trading-order-on-bybit-programmatically-32f48e25978e)
- **Minimum Order Size**: Check the minimum order quantity for a contract using `/v5/market/instruments-info` to avoid errors like “The number of contracts exceeds minimum limit allowed” (ErrCode: 10001).[](https://www.codearmo.com/python-tutorial/placing-orders-bybit-python)
- **Rate Limits**: Monitor API request frequency to avoid restrictions. Contact Bybit to increase limits if needed.[](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order)
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors like invalid order quantities or prices. Use helper functions to validate inputs (e.g., round quantities to meet `minOrderQty`).[](https://www.codearmo.com/python-tutorial/placing-orders-bybit-python)
- **Unified Trading Account (UTA)**: UTA allows cross-margin trading across Spot, Perpetuals, Futures, and Options, reducing the need to switch accounts. Ensure your API key is set for UTA if applicable.[](https://www.multicharts.com/trading-software/index.php?title=ByBit_Broker_Profile)

To place orders in a Bybit contract account using the **WebSocket API** for derivatives (e.g., USDT Perpetual, USDC Perpetual, Inverse Futures, or Options), you can leverage Bybit’s V5 Private WebSocket API, which supports order placement for faster execution compared to REST API. This feature was introduced on April 30, 2024, and is ideal for low-latency, automated trading strategies. Below is a concise guide on WebSocket order placement for contract accounts, including setup, parameters, and a practical example.

---

### **1. WebSocket Order Placement Overview**
- **Endpoint**: `wss://stream.bybit.com/v5/private` (mainnet) or `wss://stream-testnet.bybit.com/v5/private` (testnet).
- **Operation**: Use the `order.create` operation to place orders.
- **Authentication**: Requires API key, secret, and a signed request with timestamp and receive window.
- **Categories**: Supports `linear` (USDT/USDC Perpetuals), `inverse` (Inverse Futures), and `option` (Options).
- **Advantages**: Faster execution, real-time order updates, and integration with other WebSocket streams (e.g., `execution`, `position`).

---

### **2. Authentication for WebSocket**
To connect to the private WebSocket, authenticate using your API key and secret:
1. **Generate Signature**:
   - Concatenate: `GET/realtime{TIMESTAMP}5000` (where `TIMESTAMP` is the current Unix timestamp in milliseconds, and `5000` is the default receive window).
   - Compute HMAC-SHA256 using your API secret.
2. **Connect**:
   - Send an authentication message with `op: "auth"`, `apiKey`, `timestamp`, and `signature`.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "op": "auth",
       "args": ["YOUR_API_KEY", "TIMESTAMP", "SIGNATURE"]
     }
     ```

---

### **3. Key Parameters for Order Placement**
To place an order via WebSocket, use the `order.create` operation with the following parameters:
- **reqId**: A unique request ID for tracking (e.g., `order-001`).
- **header**: Includes `X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP` (Unix timestamp in ms) and `X-BAPI-RECV-WINDOW` (e.g., `5000`).
- **op**: Set to `order.create`.
- **args**: Array containing order details:
  - **category**: `linear`, `inverse`, or `option`.
  - **symbol**: Trading pair (e.g., `BTCUSDT` for linear, `BTCUSD` for inverse).
  - **side**: `Buy` or `Sell`.
  - **orderType**: `Market` or `Limit`.
  - **qty**: Order quantity (e.g., `0.001` for BTC in linear contracts, `100` USD for inverse).
  - **price**: Required for Limit orders.
  - **timeInForce**: `GTC` (Good Till Cancel), `IOC` (Immediate or Cancel), `FOK` (Fill or Kill), or `PostOnly`.
  - **orderLinkId**: Optional custom order ID (up to 36 characters, unique).
  - **takeProfit/stopLoss**: Optional TP/SL prices.
  - **positionIdx**: `0` (one-way mode), `1` (buy-side hedged), or `2` (sell-side hedged).
  - **reduceOnly**: `true`/`false` (for closing positions).

---

### **4. Example: WebSocket Order Placement**
Below is a **Python** example using the `ccxt` library with a WebSocket client to place a Limit order for a USDT Perpetual contract (`linear` category). You can adapt this for other languages or use Bybit’s official SDKs (e.g., `bybit-go-api`).

```python
import ccxt.async_support as ccxt
import asyncio
import time
import hmac
import hashlib
import websockets
import json

async def bybit_websocket_order():
    # API credentials (replace with your own)
    api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    api_secret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET'
    ws_url = 'wss://stream-testnet.bybit.com/v5/private'  # Use testnet for testing

    # Generate authentication signature
    timestamp = str(int(time.time() * 1000))
    recv_window = '5000'
    sign_string = f'GET/realtime{timestamp}{recv_window}'
    signature = hmac.new(api_secret.encode(), sign_string.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

    async with websockets.connect(ws_url) as ws:
        # Authenticate
        auth_message = {
            "op": "auth",
            "args": [api_key, timestamp, signature]
        }
        await ws.send(json.dumps(auth_message))
        auth_response = await ws.recv()
        print("Auth response:", auth_response)

        # Place a Limit order
        order_message = {
            "reqId": "order-001",
            "header": {
                "X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP": timestamp,
                "X-BAPI-RECV-WINDOW": recv_window
            },
            "op": "order.create",
            "args": [{
                "category": "linear",
                "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
                "side": "Buy",
                "orderType": "Limit",
                "qty": "0.001",
                "price": "50000",
                "timeInForce": "GTC",
                "orderLinkId": "my-limit-order-001"
            }]
        }
        await ws.send(json.dumps(order_message))
        order_response = await ws.recv()
        print("Order response:", order_response)

        # Subscribe to execution updates
        subscribe_message = {
            "op": "subscribe",
            "args": ["execution"]
        }
        await ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))
        
        # Listen for responses
        async for message in ws:
            print("Received:", message)

# Run the WebSocket client
asyncio.run(bybit_websocket_order())
```

---

### **5. Expected Response**
A successful order placement returns a response like:
```json
{
  "id": "order-001",
  "topic": "order.create",
  "creationTime": 1672211918471,
  "data": {
    "result": {
      "orderId": "1321003749386327552",
      "orderLinkId": "my-limit-order-001"
    },
    "retCode": 0,
    "retMsg": "OK"
  }
}
```

Errors (e.g., invalid quantity, insufficient margin) will include a non-zero `retCode` and `retMsg` with details, such as:
```json
{
  "id": "order-001",
  "retCode": 10001,
  "retMsg": "The number of contracts exceeds minimum limit allowed"
}
```

---

### **6. Subscribing to Execution Updates**
To monitor order executions, subscribe to the `execution` topic after placing an order:
```json
{
  "op": "subscribe",
  "args": ["execution"]
}
```
This provides real-time updates on trade executions, including order fills, which is useful for tracking TP/SL or partial fills.

---

### **7. Best Practices**
- **Testnet**: Use `wss://stream-testnet.bybit.com/v5/private` for testing to avoid risking real funds.
- **Minimum Order Size**: Verify the minimum order quantity via the REST endpoint `/v5/market/instruments-info` to avoid errors.
- **Rate Limits**: WebSocket has fewer rate limit issues than REST, but monitor connection stability.
- **Error Handling**: Parse `retCode` and `retMsg` to handle errors programmatically.
- **Keep-Alive**: Send periodic `ping` messages (e.g., `{"op": "ping"}`) to maintain the WebSocket connection.

### **8. Additional Notes**
- **Order Limits**: Up to 500 active orders per symbol for Perpetuals/Futures, 10 conditional orders per symbol.
- **Leverage**: Ensure leverage is set for the symbol (`/v5/position/set-leverage`) before placing orders, as it affects margin requirements.
- **Unified Trading Account (UTA)**: If using UTA, ensure your API key is configured for cross-margin trading across Spot, Perpetuals, and Futures.
- **Documentation**: Refer to Bybit’s V5 WebSocket API docs at `https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/websocket/private/order-create` for full details.

Authenticating with Bybit’s V5 Private WebSocket API is required to access trading functions like order placement for contract accounts (e.g., USDT Perpetual, USDC Perpetual, Inverse Futures, or Options). The authentication process ensures secure communication using your API key and secret. Below are the detailed steps and requirements for WebSocket authentication, tailored for Bybit’s private WebSocket endpoint (`wss://stream.bybit.com/v5/private` for mainnet or `wss://stream-testnet.bybit.com/v5/private` for testnet).

---

### **1. WebSocket Authentication Overview**
- **Endpoint**: 
  - Mainnet: `wss://stream.bybit.com/v5/private`
  - Testnet: `wss://stream-testnet.bybit.com/v5/private`
- **Purpose**: Authenticate to access private channels (e.g., `order.create`, `execution`, `position`, `wallet`).
- **Method**: Send an `auth` operation with a signed request using your API key and secret.
- **Timeout**: Authentication must be sent within 10 seconds of establishing the WebSocket connection, or the connection will be closed.

---

### **2. Authentication Requirements**
To authenticate, you need:
- **API Key**: Generated from your Bybit account (mainnet or testnet).
- **API Secret**: The corresponding secret for signing requests.
- **Timestamp**: Current Unix timestamp in milliseconds (e.g., `1698763740000`).
- **Receive Window**: A time buffer in milliseconds (default: `5000`) to account for network latency.
- **Signature**: An HMAC-SHA256 signature of the concatenated string `GET/realtime{TIMESTAMP}{RECV_WINDOW}` using your API secret.

---

### **3. Steps to Authenticate**
1. **Obtain API Credentials**:
   - Log in to your Bybit account (mainnet: `https://www.bybit.com`, testnet: `https://testnet.bybit.com`).
   - Navigate to the API section and create an API key with permissions for private endpoints (e.g., “Order” for trading, “Wallet” for balance).
   - Note the API key and secret.

2. **Generate Timestamp**:
   - Use the current Unix timestamp in milliseconds (e.g., `1698763740000` for a specific moment).
   - Ensure the timestamp is accurate to avoid “Timestamp expired” errors (ErrCode: 10004).

3. **Create Signature**:
   - Concatenate the string: `GET/realtime{TIMESTAMP}{RECV_WINDOW}`.
     - Example: For timestamp `1698763740000` and receive window `5000`, the string is `GET/realtime16987637400005000`.
   - Compute the HMAC-SHA256 signature using your API secret as the key.
   - The result is a hexadecimal string (64 characters).

4. **Send Authentication Message**:
   - After connecting to the WebSocket, send a JSON message with the `auth` operation:
     ```json
     {
       "op": "auth",
       "args": [
         "YOUR_API_KEY",
         "TIMESTAMP",
         "SIGNATURE"
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "op": "auth",
       "args": [
         "abc123xyz456",
         "1698763740000",
         "e4f7b7e4c3b2a1f9e8d7c6b5a4f3e2d1c0b9a8f7e6d5c4b3a2f1e0d9c8b7a6"
       ]
     }
     ```

5. **Verify Response**:
   - A successful authentication returns:
     ```json
     {
       "success": true,
       "retMsg": "",
       "op": "auth",
       "connId": "pf_123456789"
     }
     ```
   - Errors (e.g., invalid signature, expired timestamp) return:
     ```json
     {
       "success": false,
       "retMsg": "invalid sign",
       "op": "auth",
       "connId": "pf_123456789"
     }
     ```

### **4. Example: WebSocket Authentication in Python**
Below is a Python example using the `websockets` library to authenticate with Bybit’s private WebSocket:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import time
import hmac
import hashlib
import json

async def bybit_websocket_auth():
    # API credentials (replace with your own)
    api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    api_secret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET'
    ws_url = 'wss://stream-testnet.bybit.com/v5/private'  # Testnet

    # Generate timestamp and signature
    timestamp = str(int(time.time() * 1000))
    recv_window = '5000'
    sign_string = f'GET/realtime{timestamp}{recv_window}'
    signature = hmac.new(
        api_secret.encode('utf-8'),
        sign_string.encode('utf-8'),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()

    # Authentication message
    auth_message = {
        "op": "auth",
        "args": [api_key, timestamp, signature]
    }

    async with websockets.connect(ws_url) as ws:
        # Send authentication
        await ws.send(json.dumps(auth_message))
        auth_response = await ws.recv()
        print("Auth response:", auth_response)

        # Example: Subscribe to execution updates after authentication
        subscribe_message = {
            "op": "subscribe",
            "args": ["execution"]
        }
        await ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))

        # Listen for responses
        async for message in ws:
            print("Received:", message)

# Run the WebSocket client
asyncio.run(bybit_websocket_auth())
```

### **5. Common Errors and Troubleshooting**
- **“Invalid sign” (retCode: 10004)**:
  - Cause: Incorrect signature due to wrong API secret or string format.
  - Fix: Verify the concatenated string is exactly `GET/realtime{TIMESTAMP}{RECV_WINDOW}` and the API secret is correct.
- **“Timestamp expired” (retCode: 10004)**:
  - Cause: Timestamp is too old or differs significantly from server time.
  - Fix: Synchronize your system clock and generate a fresh timestamp.
- **“Invalid API key”**:
  - Cause: Incorrect or inactive API key.
  - Fix: Ensure the API key is valid and has permissions for private endpoints (check in Bybit’s API management).
- **Connection Timeout**:
  - Cause: Authentication not sent within 10 seconds.
  - Fix: Send the `auth` message immediately after connecting.

---

### **6. Best Practices**
- **Testnet**: Use `wss://stream-testnet.bybit.com/v5/private` for testing to avoid risking real funds.
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Use a reliable time source (e.g., NTP) to prevent timestamp-related errors.
- **Receive Window**: Default is `5000` ms, but adjust if network latency is high (contact Bybit for higher limits if needed).
- **Keep-Alive**: Send periodic `ping` messages (e.g., `{"op": "ping"}`) every 20 seconds to maintain the connection.
- **Error Handling**: Parse `success` and `retMsg` in responses to handle authentication failures gracefully.
- **API Key Security**: Store API keys and secrets securely (e.g., environment variables) and avoid exposing them in code.

---

### **7. Post-Authentication**
After successful authentication, you can:
- **Place Orders**: Use the `order.create` operation (see previous response for details).
- **Subscribe to Private Topics**: Access real-time data for:
  - `execution`: Trade execution updates.
  - `order`: Order status updates.
  - `position`: Position changes.
  - `wallet`: Balance updates.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "op": "subscribe",
      "args": ["execution", "order", "position", "wallet"]
    }
    ```
