    "reasoning": "The market data for TRUMPUSDT presents a compelling, albeit high-risk, scalping opportunity for a quick bounce. Multiple oscillators (RSI, Stochastic RSI, CCI) are flashing extremely oversold conditions, with the RSI at 6.08 and Stochastic RSI at 0. Furthermore, the current price is significantly below the Lower Bollinger Band, a classic signal for potential mean reversion. While the overall trend and momentum indicators (MACD line below signal, current price below both EMAs, high ADX indicating strong trend, MFI showing outflow, VWAP significantly above current price) point to strong underlying bearish pressure, the extreme oversold state suggests an imminent exhaustion of sellers and a high probability of a short-term counter-trend rebound. The 3-minute Supertrend being 'UP' provides a minor, immediate bullish confirmation, despite the conflicting 3-minute EMA trend. The high ATR (479.62) indicates significant volatility, which can be advantageous for scalping but also increases risk. Due to the counter-trend nature of this trade against a strong bearish backdrop, strict risk management with tight stop-losses and quick profit-taking is paramount.",

      "action": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 75,
      "reasoning": "The market data presents a conflicted scenario for immediate scalping. The prevailing momentum is strongly bearish, indicated by a bearish MACD crossover, EMA short crossing below EMA long, negative CCI, and the current price trading significantly below VWAP. The ADX at an extreme 100 confirms a very strong trend, which, coupled with the other bearish indicators and the 3min/15min EMA trends being 'DOWN', suggests a robust downtrend.\n\nHowever, counterbalancing these bearish signals are the deeply oversold conditions observed in the Money Flow Index (MFI at 23.15) and Stochastic RSI (D-line at 29.29, with K crossing D), which strongly suggest a short-term bounce or reversal is imminent. While RSI at 63.86 is not overbought, it indicates recent buying pressure may be waning.\n\nFurther adding to the complexity are the multi-timeframe Supertrend indicators, which are 'UP' on both 3min and 15min charts, conflicting directly with the 'DOWN' EMA trends on the same timeframes. This divergence creates significant uncertainty regarding the immediate directional bias.\n\nFor a scalper, this confluence of a strong bearish trend with deeply oversold conditions and conflicting multi-timeframe signals leads to a high-risk entry point. Initiating a 'SELL' now carries the risk of a sharp bounce due to oversold conditions. Conversely, initiating a 'BUY' for an oversold bounce goes directly against a confirmed strong bearish trend (ADX 100, MACD, EMA, MFI, CCI). The current price ($8.535) is just below the Middle Bollinger Band ($8.5389), offering limited immediate upside for a bounce scalp.\n\nTherefore, the most prudent action is to 'HOLD'. A scalper should wait for further confirmation, either for the oversold bounce to materialize and then look for a short entry from a defined resistance level, or for clear signs of a reversal that can sustain a bullish scalp. The low ATR also suggests limited volatility, which can make scalping challenging without clear directional conviction.",

The ADX at an extremely high 100 points to an undeniable trend strength. When combined with critical bearish indicators such as an MFI of 17.78 (suggesting intense money outflow), the current price trading significantly below its Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), and consistently 'DOWN' EMA trends across both 3-minute and 15-minute timeframes, the direction of this strong trend is clearly downward. Furthermore, the MACD's bearish crossover and negative histogram reinforce the momentum shift to the downside. While the RSI is near overbought, it implies limited room for further upward movement, and the Supertrend indicating 'UP' is likely a lagging signal or reflective of a minor counter-trend bounce within a larger bearish move. Scalping in the direction of such strong confluence offers the best risk/reward, with an entry near resistance (Upper Bollinger Band) and a target at support (Lower Bollinger Band), protected by a tight stop-loss due to the inherent volatility and rapid price movements associated with an ADX of 100.",

The current price ($8.54) is trading below the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of $8.63, further signaling selling pressure. A crucial observation is the significant divergence between the RSI (68.10), which is nearing overbought, and the Money Flow Index (MFI) at an extremely low 17.78. This often signals that any recent price strength lacks genuine buying conviction and is likely unsustainable, indicating potential for a reversal downwards. While the Stochastic RSI K is in overbought territory (75.29), it supports the idea of limited immediate upside. Although the Supertrend indicates an overall UP trend on both timeframes, the confluence of immediate momentum indicators (MACD, EMAs, VWAP, MFI divergence) suggests a high probability of a short-term corrective move downwards, suitable for a scalping strategy. The high ADX (100) confirms a strong trend is in play, and based on the majority of short-term signals, this strength appears to be aligned with bearish pressure for the immediate future.

The exceptionally high ADX (100) indicates strong trend strength; in this scenario, combined with oversold oscillators, it often points to a strong move nearing exhaustion, setting up for a reversal. The current price being significantly below VWAP also presents a mean reversion opportunity.

      "reasoning": "The market data for TRUMPUSDT presents a highly mixed and consolidating picture, making a clear scalping entry challenging. While the 3-minute EMA and Supertrend indicate 'UP', the 15-minute EMA trend is 'DOWN', creating a divergence that signals uncertainty. Most momentum oscillators (RSI, Stochastic RSI, MFI, CCI) are in neutral territory, failing to show strong buying or selling pressure. The price is currently hugging the Bollinger Bands' Middle Band, with tight bands and low ATR, indicative of range-bound movement and low volatility. The current price is also significantly below the VWAP, hinting at an underlying bearish sentiment from a broader intraday perspective. Although the ADX is an extremely high 100, signifying a strong established trend, the immediate -0.01% price change and tight consolidation suggest that the asset is either in a pause or accumulation/distribution phase, with the direction of the next strong move unclear. Scalping demands clear, immediate momentum and a strong edge, which is currently absent. Entering a trade in such conflicting and consolidating conditions carries a higher risk of whipsaws and limited profit potential. Therefore, the most prudent action for a scalper is to HOLD and await a clear breakout or breakdown from the current consolidation, confirmed by volume and aligned momentum across multiple short timeframes, before considering an entry.",

This confluence suggests an immediate upward impulse is likely. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) being low (33.06) indicates a lack of significant new money entering, and the current price is below the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), both suggesting potential weakness in buying support. Furthermore, the 15-minute EMA trend being DOWN directly contradicts the shorter-term bullishness, hinting at a potential reversal or retrace on a slightly longer timeframe. Price is also near the Upper Bollinger Band, which often acts as resistance. Therefore, a 'BUY' signal is issued to capitalize on the immediate strong momentum, but the 'confidence' is moderate and 'riskLevel' is 'HIGH' due to these conflicting signals.

The current price ($8.546) is above the Bollinger Middle Band and pressing towards the Upper Bollinger Band ($8.552), suggesting potential for a quick push higher or a brief breakout. This confluence of factors makes a BUY signal viable for a rapid scalping opportunity. However, the risk level is set to MEDIUM due to several cautionary signals: The Money Flow Index (MFI) is low at 33.06, indicating a lack of strong institutional money flowing into the asset, which could limit sustained upward movement. The current price is also significantly below the VWAP ($8.637), suggesting that, on average, participants are holding positions at higher prices. Furthermore, the 15-minute EMA trend is 'DOWN', directly contradicting the shorter-term bullishness, and the Stochastic RSI (K<D) suggests a slight short-term bearish crossover. These conflicting signals imply that while the immediate momentum is strong, the upward move might be fleeting and vulnerable to quick reversals.

Critically, the 15-minute EMA trend is DOWN, creating a bearish divergence on a slightly longer timeframe. Furthermore, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is below 50, indicating money is flowing out or buying pressure is weakening, and the current price is below the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), which are both bearish signals. Given these factors, particularly the price hitting strong resistance at the Upper BB amidst weak underlying trend strength and longer-term bearish bias, a scalping opportunity arises for a quick short trade if the Upper BB holds.

This lack of clear direction is further compounded by conflicting multi-timeframe EMA trends: a bullish signal on the 3-minute timeframe ('UP') directly opposes a bearish signal on the 15-minute timeframe ('DOWN'). Key oscillator indicators such as RSI (50.76) and Stochastic RSI (K=33, D=32) reside in neutral territory, offering no strong overbought or oversold cues for mean reversion. While MACD shows a tiny positive histogram and EMA Short is marginally above EMA Long, suggesting a very weak bullish lean, these are contradicted by the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 40.91 (indicating money outflow or lack of buying pressure) and the current price being significantly below VWAP ($8.637), both of which are bearish signals. The price is also tightly consolidating around the Bollinger Middle Band ($8.5407), indicating low volatility and indecision. Given these mixed, weak, and conflicting signals, attempting a directional scalping trade at this juncture carries a very high risk of being 'chopped out' by short-term reversals within a range-bound market.

Simultaneously, the EMA Short has crossed above the EMA Long. The 3-minute EMA trend is also indicating an upward movement, suggesting a very short-term bullish push.\n2.  **Bollinger Bands & Price Action:** The current price ($8.543) is just above the Middle Bollinger Band ($8.5407) and has room to move towards the Upper Band ($8.5529).

This strong bearish trend makes the 'BUY' signal a higher-risk, counter-trend scalp. However, the extreme oversold state suggests that a temporary relief rally or 'dead cat bounce' is highly probable for quick profit-taking. Money flow (MFI 37.91) is not indicating strong buying pressure yet, but this is expected at extreme lows before a bounce. The significantly lower current price relative to VWAP (115817.15) also reinforces the current bearish sentiment but makes the potential bounce more attractive on a percentage basis if it occurs.\n\nThe strategy is to capitalize on a short-term technical bounce from these extreme oversold conditions.

Furthermore, there's a severe discrepancy where the current price ($1.0741) is vastly different from the calculated EMA, Bollinger Bands, and VWAP values (all in the 100,000 range), making these indicators unreliable for current price action and suggesting fundamental data errors or a major market event like a re-listing at a drastically reduced value. \n\nDespite these critical issues, from a purely technical, highly speculative scalping perspective, the asset is trading at an extremely oversold level across multiple indicators (RSI 6.34, Stochastic RSI 0, CCI -201.5). These conditions, immediately following a catastrophic collapse, can sometimes trigger a very short-lived, volatile 'dead cat bounce' as aggressive counter-trend scalpers attempt to profit from temporary oversold corrections. While the MACD and EMA trends remain deeply bearish (confirming the overall downtrend), the 3min and 15min Supertrend indicators show 'UP' signals, offering a weak, contradictory hint for a temporary upward move. \n\nThis 'BUY' signal is therefore an extremely low-confidence, high-risk, counter-trend speculation, based solely on the extreme oversold state and the possibility of an immediate, minimal technical rebound. It is imperative to acknowledge the immense risk due to the -100% price change and severe data inconsistencies. Most traders should **avoid** this asset. Only highly aggressive, experienced scalpers with robust risk management and minimal capital should consider this, treating it as pure speculation.",

Crucially, the current price ($107369.8) is trading below the Lower Bollinger Band ($107550.05), which is a strong reversal signal for a bounce back into the bands. While the 3-minute EMA trend is 'DOWN' and ADX (43.9) shows strong trend strength (likely bearish), such extreme oversold levels often lead to a relief rally or a sharp bounce before potentially continuing the larger trend. The MFI (37.77) indicates money flowing out, and price is below VWAP and EMAs, reinforcing the bearish undertone, but these are secondary to the immediate oversold bounce opportunity. The 3min Supertrend being 'UP' is a conflicting signal that might be lagging or indicating a very recent attempt at a bounce that was quickly rejected; however, the overwhelming oversold conditions take precedence for a scalping strategy.

      "reasoning": "The market data presents a highly compelling scalping opportunity for a short-term 'BUY' based on extreme oversold conditions, despite the overarching bearish trend. The RSI (6.08), Stochastic RSI (K=0, D=0), and CCI (-206.78) are all flashing extremely oversold signals, indicating that selling pressure is at an exhaustion point. Furthermore, the current price ($107369.8) is trading below the Lower Bollinger Band ($107550.05), which is a strong mean-reversion signal, suggesting an imminent bounce back into the bands is highly probable. While the MACD, EMA trends (3min DOWN), and ADX (43.9, strong trend) confirm a strong bearish momentum in the broader short-term context, scalpers actively seek these counter-trend bounces from extreme conditions. The '3min Supertrend: UP' is a conflicting signal, but given the overwhelming confluence of oversold indicators, it might be an early, very short-term confirmation of buying interest emerging from the bottom. The risk is that the strong bearish trend might continue to push the price lower, making a tight stop-loss essential. This is a high-probability, short-duration scalp aiming for a quick profit on a corrective bounce.",

Furthermore, the current price ($107369.8) has dropped below the Lower Bollinger Band ($107550.05), which often precedes a mean reversion bounce back into the bands. While the broader trend is strongly bearish (EMAs, MACD, ADX 43.9 indicating strong trend, VWAP, MFI, and 3min EMA Trend 'DOWN'), these extreme oversold signals present a high-probability scalping opportunity for a counter-trend bounce. The 3-minute Supertrend showing 'UP' is a minor, potentially early, indication of a very short-term reversal attempt.

Multiple oscillators (RSI, Stochastic RSI, CCI) are flashing extremely oversold conditions, with the RSI at 6.08 and Stochastic RSI at 0. Furthermore, the current price is significantly below the Lower Bollinger Band, a classic signal for potential mean reversion. While the overall trend and momentum indicators (MACD line below signal, current price below both EMAs, high ADX indicating strong trend, MFI showing outflow, VWAP significantly above current price) point to strong underlying bearish pressure, the extreme oversold state suggests an imminent exhaustion of sellers and a high probability of a short-term counter-trend rebound. The 3-minute Supertrend being 'UP' provides a minor, immediate bullish confirmation, despite the conflicting 3-minute EMA trend. The high ATR (479.62) indicates significant volatility, which can be advantageous for scalping but also increases risk. Due to the counter-trend nature of this trade against a strong bearish backdrop, strict risk management with tight stop-losses and quick profit-taking is paramount.",
