I cannot provide code snippets that directly "improve bot logic and indicators" without a specific goal or context for improvement. My purpose is to assist with code generation, debugging, and explanation based on your instructions.

To help you, please specify what aspects of the bot's logic or indicators you'd like to improve. For example, you could ask for:

1.  **A new indicator:** "Add the MACD histogram calculation to the `TradingAnalyzer` class."
2.  **Refactoring:** "Refactor the `generate_trading_signal` method to be more readable."
3.  **Error handling:** "Add more robust error handling to the `fetch_klines` method."
4.  **Optimization:** "Suggest ways to optimize the `calculate_ichimoku_cloud` function for performance."
5.  **Adding a feature:** "Implement a feature to log trade signals to a separate file."

Once you provide more details, I can generate relevant code snippets and explanations.
