2:4###  Rate Limits

| Category | Requests Per Minute |
| --- | --- |
| Market Data Endpoints | 120 |
| Order Management | 60 |
| Position Queries | 120 |

2:5###  Implementation Example

```javascript
const { RestClientV5 } = require('bybit-api');

const client = new RestClientV5({
  key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  secret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET'
});

// Example: Get account info
client.getAccountInfo()
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

// Example: Subscribe to WebSocket topics
const ws = new WebsocketClient({
  key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  secret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET'
});

ws.subscribeV5(['orderbook.50.BTCUSDT', 'kline.5.BTCUSDT'], 'linear');
```

1:12 1:14###  Important Notes

1. Always implement proper error handling and rate limiting
2. Use WebSockets for real-time data instead of polling REST endpoints
3. Enable IP restrictions on your API keys
4. Never expose API secrets in client-side code

#### 1. Create Agent Directory

Create a new agent directory structure 0:12:

```bash
mkdir -p agents/myagent
cd agents/myagent
```

#### 2. Basic Configuration

Create `config.yaml` with essential settings:

```yaml
model: openai:gpt-4o             # Specify the LLM to use
temperature: null                # Set default temperature parameter
top_p: null                      # Set default top-p parameter
use_tools: null                  # Additional tools for the agent
agent_prelude: null              # Session to use when starting the agent
instructions: null               # Override default instructions
```

### Advanced Configuration Options

#### 1. Session Management

Configure session persistence and behavior 0:8:

```yaml
save_session: null              # Controls session persistence
compress_threshold: 4000         # Auto-compress when token count exceeds this
summarize_prompt: '...'         # Prompt for concise history summaries
summary_prompt: '...'           # Prompt for full session summaries
```

#### 2. Tool Integration

Configure tool access and behavior 0:6:

```yaml
function_calling: true           # Enables function calling globally
mapping_tools:                   # Alias for a tool or toolset
  fs: 'fs_cat,fs_ls,fs_mkdir,fs_rm,fs_write'
use_tools: fs                    # Use the fs toolset by default
```

### Agent-Specific Features

#### 1. Instructions

Define custom instructions for your agent 0:12:

```yaml
instructions:
  - name: greet
    prompt: "Act friendly and welcoming"
    description: "Greeting interaction"
  - name: technical
    prompt: "Be precise and technical"
    description: "Technical discussion"
```

#### 2. Variables

Set default variables for your agent:

```yaml
variables:
  greeting: "Hello! I'm your AI assistant"
  expertise: "Technical support and programming"
```

### Testing and Validation

#### 1. Basic Testing

Test your agent configuration 11:5:

```bash
# List available agents
aichat --list-agents

# Test agent configuration
aichat -a myagent --validate-config

# Run basic test
aichat -a myagent --test
```

#### 2. Advanced Testing

Test specific aspects of your agent:

```bash
# Test with specific input
aichat -a myagent --test --input "What is your purpose?"

# Test in non-stream mode
aichat -a myagent --test -S

# Test with debug logging
AICHAT_LOG_LEVEL=debug aichat -a myagent --test
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. Configuration Errors:
```bash
# Check configuration
aichat -a myagent --info

# Validate configuration
aichat -a myagent --validate-config
```


2. Tool Integration Issues:
```bash
# Check tool availability
aichat -a myagent --list-tools

# Test specific tool
aichat -a myagent --test-tool <tool_name>
```


3. Session Problems:
```bash
# Check session status
aichat -a myagent --list-sessions

# Clear session data
aichat -a myagent --clear-session
```



### Best Practices

1. Configuration Management:
  - Keep configurations modular and well-documented
  - Use version control for configuration files
  - Test configurations thoroughly before deployment


2. Tool Integration:
  - Group related tools together using `mapping_tools`
  - Test tools individually before adding to agent
  - Monitor tool execution times and resource usage


3. Session Management:
  - Set appropriate `compress_threshold` based on use case
  - Use meaningful `summarize_prompt` for context preservation
  - Regularly clean up old sessions



Remember to validate your agent's configuration before deployment:

```bash
aichat -a myagent --validate-config
```

## Advanced Principles of Good Coding Practice: Pyrmethus's Expanded Codex

### I. Enhanced Readability & Maintainability (15 Improvements)

1.  **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Beyond basic descriptiveness, enforce a uniform convention (e.g., `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for classes/components, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants).
2.  **Leverage Type Hinting/Static Typing:** (Python: Type Hinting, JS/TS: TypeScript) Explicitly define expected data types for function arguments, return values, and variables. This catches errors early and improves code clarity.
3.  **Minimize Nesting Depth:** Aim for flatter code structures. Deeply nested `if` statements or loops can be refactored using guard clauses, early returns, or helper functions.
4.  **Boolean Logic Clarity:** Use explicit boolean checks (`if (isActive === true)`) rather than implicit ones (`if (isActive)`), especially when dealing with potentially falsy values that are valid states.
5.  **Avoid Magic Numbers/Strings:** Replace literal values with named constants. This makes the code self-documenting and easier to update.
    *   *Example:* `MAX_RETRIES = 5` instead of using `5` directly in retry logic.
6.  **Purposeful Whitespace:** Use blank lines strategically to visually separate logical blocks of code within functions or classes.
7.  **Limit Line Length:** Keep lines of code reasonably short (e.g., 79-120 characters) to improve readability, especially on smaller screens or terminals.
8.  **Group Imports/Includes:** Organize import statements logically (e.g., standard libraries first, then third-party, then local modules).
9.  **Use `const` for Immutable Variables (JavaScript):** When a variable's assignment should not change, use `const`. This signals intent and prevents accidental reassignment.
10. **Prefer `let` over `var` (JavaScript):** `let` has block-scoping, which is generally more predictable and less error-prone than `var`'s function-scoping.
11. **Meaningful Error Messages:** Ensure error messages are informative, providing context about what went wrong and potentially how to fix it.
12. **Code Formatting Tools:** Integrate linters (like ESLint, Pylint) and formatters (like Prettier, Black) into your development workflow. Automate style enforcement.
13. **Atomic Commits:** Each commit should represent a single, logical change. Avoid committing unrelated changes together.
14. **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Follow conventions like Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) to provide context and enable automated changelog generation.
15. **Regular Code Reviews:** Have peers review your code. Fresh eyes can spot issues, suggest improvements, and ensure adherence to standards.

### II. Enhanced Robustness & Error Handling (15 Improvements)

16. **Specific Exception Handling:** Catch specific exceptions rather than broad `Exception` or `Error` types where possible. This prevents accidentally masking unrelated errors.
17. **Fail Fast:** If a critical precondition isn't met, exit early with a clear error message rather than proceeding with potentially invalid state.
18. **Resource Cleanup:** Ensure resources (files, network connections, locks) are always released, even if errors occur. Use `try-finally` blocks or context managers (`with` statement in Python).
19. **Idempotent Operations:** Design operations so that calling them multiple times has the same effect as calling them once. This is crucial for retries and distributed systems.
20. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Implement mechanisms to temporarily stop making requests to a failing service after a certain number of failures, preventing cascading failures.
21. **Graceful Degradation:** If a non-critical component fails, allow the application to continue functioning in a degraded mode rather than crashing entirely.
22. **Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for network requests and external API calls to prevent the application from hanging indefinitely.
23. **Rate Limiting Awareness:** Implement logic to respect API rate limits, using backoff strategies and potentially queuing requests.
24. **Data Integrity Checks:** Validate data received from external sources or after complex transformations to ensure it remains consistent and correct.
25. **State Validation:** Periodically check the internal state of the application for inconsistencies, especially in long-running processes.
26. **Sanitize Output:** Just as input needs sanitization, ensure output (especially if displayed to users or written to files) is properly escaped or formatted to prevent rendering issues or security risks.
27. **Use `unknown` over `any` (TypeScript):** As noted in the prompt, `unknown` forces type checking, making code safer than `any`.
28. **Minimize Type Assertions (`as Type`):** Use type assertions sparingly. They bypass type checking and can hide errors. Prefer explicit type guards or safer casting methods when possible.
29. **Immutable Data Structures:** Where feasible, use immutable data structures (e.g., tuples in Python, libraries like Immer in JS) to prevent unintended side effects and simplify state management.
30. **Robust Logging Levels:** Utilize different logging levels effectively. `DEBUG` for detailed tracing, `INFO` for general operational flow, `WARNING` for potential issues, `ERROR` for failures, and `CRITICAL` for fatal errors.

### III. Enhanced Modularity & Reusability (10 Improvements)

31. **Custom Hooks (React/JS):** Abstract reusable logic (stateful or side-effectful) into custom hooks for cleaner component code.
32. **Configuration Objects:** Encapsulate related configuration settings into well-defined objects or dictionaries, making them easier to manage and pass around.
33. **Dependency Injection:** Pass dependencies (like clients, configurations, services) into functions or classes rather than having them create their own. This improves testability and flexibility.
34. **Pure Functions:** Aim for pure functions – functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. These are highly predictable and testable.
35. **Functional Array Methods:** Embrace `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.forEach()`, etc., for data transformations. They promote immutability and declarative programming.
36. **Module-Level Constants:** Define constants at the module level (using `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` or similar) for values used throughout that module.
37. **Clear Public API (Modules):** Explicitly export only the necessary functions and variables from a module, hiding internal implementation details.
38. **Separate Concerns:** Ensure different aspects of functionality reside in distinct modules (e.g., API interaction, data processing, UI rendering).
39. **Parameter Objects:** For functions with many optional parameters, consider accepting a single configuration object instead of a long list of arguments.
40. **Avoid Global State:** Minimize reliance on global variables. Pass necessary data as arguments or manage state within components/classes/modules.

### IV. Enhanced Efficiency & Performance (10 Improvements)

41. **Memoization:** Cache the results of expensive function calls (e.g., using `functools.lru_cache` in Python, `useMemo` in React).
42. **Lazy Loading:** Load resources or components only when they are needed, improving initial load times.
43. **Efficient Data Structures:** Choose the right tool for the job (e.g., sets for fast membership checking, dictionaries/maps for key-value lookups).
44. **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilize asynchronous programming (async/await, Promises, threading) for I/O-bound tasks to prevent blocking the main execution thread.
45. **Batching Operations:** Group multiple similar operations (e.g., API calls, database writes) into a single batch to reduce overhead.
46. **Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks accurately before attempting optimizations.
47. **Connection Pooling:** Reuse existing connections (e.g., database connections, HTTP clients) instead of establishing new ones for each request.
48. **Efficient String Concatenation:** In performance-critical loops, use methods like `"".join(list)` (Python) or template literals/array joins (JavaScript) instead of repeated `+` operations.
49. **Avoid Unnecessary Computations:** Ensure calculations are only performed when their results are actually needed.
50. **Optimize Loops:** Be mindful of operations performed inside loops. Move invariant calculations outside the loop. Consider vectorized operations (like NumPy in Python) where applicable.
