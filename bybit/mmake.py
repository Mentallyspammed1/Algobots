The provided file `mmake.md` appears to contain three concatenated versions of a Python market-making bot script. Let's analyze the evolution of the bot across these versions, focusing on how features are **merged**, **upgraded**, and **enhanced**.

For clarity, we'll refer to the first complete script as "Version 1" (V1), the second as "Version 2" (V2), and the third as "Version 3" (V3). A quick scan reveals that V2 and V3 are identical. Therefore, our analysis will primarily focus on the changes from V1 to V2.

### Version 1: MMXCEL v2.9.1 (Initial State)

This version presents a functional Bybit Hedge-Mode Market-Making Bot.

**Key Features & Design:**
*   **Core Logic:** Places buy/sell limit orders around the mid-price, rebalances positions, and implements stop-loss/profit-taking.
*   **Configuration:** Loads parameters from `config.json` and API keys from `.env`.
*   **Precision:** Uses `Decimal` for all financial calculations (`getcontext().prec = 12`).
*   **User Interface:** Provides a real-time console display with `colorama` and optional `termcolor`, including a "neon" aesthetic. Features interactive hotkeys (`q`, `c`, `r`).
*   **Logging:** Configured with `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler` (5MB max, 5 backups).
*   **External Notifications:** Integrates `termux-toast` for mobile notifications.
*   **API Interaction (`BybitClient`):**
    *   Uses `pybit.unified_trading.HTTP` and `WebSocket`.
    *   Includes a generic `_api` wrapper with retry logic and exponential backoff (`MAX_RETRIES = 5`, `RETRY_DELAY_API = 2s`).
    *   Fetches symbol information (`price_precision`, `qty_precision`, `min_order_value`, `min_price`, `min_qty`).
    *   Syncs open orders and positions via REST API.
    *   Handles order placement (`place_order`, `place_batch_orders`) with client-side quantization and minimum value checks.
    *   Handles order cancellation.
    *   Monitors WebSocket connection status (`_monitor_websockets`).
*   **Strategy (`MarketMakingStrategy`):**
    *   **Dynamic Quantity:** `_calculate_dynamic_quantity` adjusts order size based on available balance, mid-price, and market volatility.
    *   **Order Management:** Places market-making orders, cancels stale orders based on `ORDER_LIFESPAN_SECONDS`, and re-places orders if price moves beyond `PRICE_THRESHOLD`.
    *   **Risk Management:** Includes `_detect_abnormal_conditions` (a "circuit breaker") that pauses trading and cancels orders if the spread is `ABNORMAL_SPREAD_THRESHOLD` or if market data is invalid.
    *   **Rebalancing:** `rebalance_inventory` attempts to neutralize net position if it exceeds `REBALANCE_THRESHOLD_QTY`, using configurable `REBALANCE_ORDER_TYPE` (Market/Limit) and `REBALANCE_PRICE_OFFSET_PERCENTAGE`.
    *   **PnL Management:** `monitor_pnl` checks for `PROFIT_PERCENTAGE` and `STOP_LOSS_PERCENTAGE` triggers, closing positions with market orders.
*   **State Management:** Uses a global `ws_state` dictionary for real-time market data, open orders, and positions, updated by WebSocket and periodically synced by REST. A global `BOT_STATE` tracks the bot's operational status.
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** Implements `signal_handler` for `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` to allow for clean exit and order cancellation.

### Version 2 (and 3): Refactored & Enhanced

This version shows a significant architectural refactoring and introduces new features while simplifying or removing others.

**Key Changes from V1 to V2:**

#### 1. Merge (Integration & Refinement of Existing Components)

*   **Modularization:** The core logic remains split between `BybitClient` (for exchange interaction) and `MarketMakingStrategy` (for trading logic), reinforcing a clean separation of concerns.
*   **UI Integration:** The UI display (`print_neon_header`, `print_neon_separator`, `format_metric`) is more tightly integrated into the main `strategy.run()` loop, and new helper functions like `format_order` and `format_position` are introduced for clearer display of trading data.
*   **Centralized Control:** The main execution flow is encapsulated within `MarketMakingStrategy.run()`, which then manages its own periodic tasks (`_periodic_task` for rebalancing and PnL monitoring) and interacts with the `BybitClient`. This makes the bot's lifecycle more predictable.
*   **WebSocket State:** The `ws_state` dictionary continues to be the central repository for real-time data from WebSockets, which is then consumed by the strategy.

#### 2. Upgrade (Improvements to Existing Functionalities)

*   **API Call Robustness:**
    *   The `_api` method is renamed to `_make_api_call` and enhanced with an `api_call_cooldown` (0.1s) to explicitly manage rate limits, preventing API spam.
    *   `MAX_RETRIES` for API calls is reduced from 5 to 3, potentially indicating more confidence in the API or faster failure detection.
*   **Configuration Validation:** A crucial `_validate_config` method is added to `MarketMakingStrategy`. This performs comprehensive checks on all critical configuration parameters (e.g., positive decimals, valid integers) at startup. This significantly improves bot reliability by catching common user errors before trading begins.
*   **Dynamic Order Refresh Interval:** The `place_market_making_orders` method now dynamically adjusts `order_refresh_interval` between `MIN_ORDER_REFRESH_INTERVAL` and `MAX_ORDER_REFRESH_INTERVAL`. If multiple attempts to manage orders fail, the interval increases (backoff); if successful, it decreases. This makes API usage more adaptive to network conditions or exchange load.
*   **PnL Calculation Accuracy:** The `manage_stop_loss_and_profit_take` (formerly `monitor_pnl`) corrects the PnL percentage calculation. Instead of `(mid - entry_price) / entry_price` (which is a percentage of price change), it now calculates `pnl_usdt / (long_avg_price * long_size)` (percentage of *entry value*), providing a more accurate representation of portfolio performance.
*   **Decimal Precision:** `getcontext().prec` is set to 10 (from 12), a minor adjustment that might reflect a balance between precision and performance. `_calculate_decimal_precision` is improved to handle `Decimal("0")` gracefully.
*   **Error Handling:** More specific `try-except` blocks are added in WebSocket callbacks and API interaction methods, logging `type(e).__name__` and `exc_info=True` for better debugging.
*   **Toast Notifications:** `send_toast` gains a `duration` parameter for more control over notification display time.

#### 3. Enhance (New Features & Capabilities)

*   **Explicit Position Mode Setting:** The `BybitClient.set_position_mode` method is introduced, allowing the bot to explicitly set the exchange's position mode (e.g., "HedgeMode"). This is vital for ensuring the bot operates in the intended trading environment.
*   **Structured Bot Lifecycle:** The introduction of `MarketMakingStrategy.run()` and `MarketMakingStrategy.shutdown()` methods provides a more formal and controlled lifecycle for the bot, making startup, operation, and graceful termination more robust.
*   **Periodic Task Management:** The `_periodic_task` helper function allows for easy creation and management of recurring background tasks (like rebalancing and PnL monitoring), simplifying the main loop.
*   **Orderbook Snapshot (REST):** `BybitClient.get_orderbook_snapshot` is added. While not fully integrated as the primary market data source in the main loop, its presence enhances the client's capability to fetch market data via REST as a fallback or for specific needs.
*   **Dedicated Balance Coin:** `COIN_FOR_BALANCE` is now a configurable parameter, allowing users to specify which coin's balance to monitor.
*   **Improved UI Display:** The console output is significantly enhanced with more structured sections, clearer labels, and the use of `format_order` and `format_position` for better readability of active trades and positions.

#### Notable Removals/Simplifications (Potential Regressions)

While V2 brings many improvements, it also removes or simplifies some features present in V1:

*   **Loss of Dynamic Quantity:** The `_calculate_dynamic_quantity` function is removed. Order `QUANTITY` is now a fixed value from the configuration. This means the bot no longer dynamically adjusts order size based on available capital or market volatility, making it less adaptive to changing portfolio size or market conditions.
*   **Removal of Circuit Breaker:** The `_detect_abnormal_conditions` function and the associated circuit breaker logic (`ABNORMAL_SPREAD_THRESHOLD`) are entirely removed. This is a significant regression in risk management, leaving the bot vulnerable to extreme market conditions (e.g., excessively wide spreads, bid price exceeding ask price) without an automatic pause or shutdown mechanism.
*   **Less Proactive Order Validation:** The client-side checks for `min_order_value`, `min_price`, and `min_qty` during order placement (`place_order`, `place_batch_orders`) are removed. The bot now relies solely on the exchange's API to reject invalid orders, which is less proactive and could lead to more API errors.
*   **Reduced Interactivity:** The interactive hotkeys (`q`, `c`, `r`) for quitting, canceling all orders, and forcing rebalance are removed from the main display loop. User interaction is now primarily through `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` for shutdown.
*   **No Explicit WS Monitoring Task:** The `_monitor_websockets` task in `BybitClient` is removed. While the `pybit` library handles WebSocket reconnections internally, the bot no longer explicitly logs or toasts warnings about WS disconnections beyond what `pybit` itself might log.

### Conclusion

The evolution from Version 1 to Version 2 (and 3) represents a **mixed bag of architectural upgrades, functional enhancements, and strategic simplifications/regressions**.

*   **Architecturally, it's an upgrade:** The code is more modular, better organized with clear task management, and includes robust configuration validation and API call handling. The UI is also significantly improved for readability.
*   **Functionally, it's enhanced** with explicit position mode setting and more accurate PnL calculation.

However, the **strategic capabilities and safety features have been simplified or removed**. The most critical change is the **removal of the circuit breaker and dynamic quantity adjustment**. These omissions make the bot less adaptive to market changes and significantly increase its exposure to risk during abnormal market conditions.

It appears the author prioritized a cleaner, more robust core API interaction and bot lifecycle, possibly at the expense of some of the more advanced dynamic trading logic and immediate risk management features present in the earlier version. This might be a deliberate design choice for a simpler, more "set-and-forget" bot, or a trade-off made during refactoring. For a production market-making bot, the absence of a circuit breaker is a serious concern.
