## üìñ Overview

This trading bot is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. It separates the core trading logic from the strategy, configuration, and logging, making it easy to customize and maintain.

The bot performs the following functions:
- Connects to the Bybit exchange using API keys.
- Fetches real-time and historical market data.
- Loads a custom trading strategy from a separate file.
- Executes trades based on the signals generated by the strategy.
- Provides detailed logging of its operations.

## üìÇ File Structure

Here is a breakdown of the key files in this project:

-   `main.py`: The main entry point to start the bot.
-   `market_making_strategy.py`: The core market making strategy.
-   `bot_config.yaml`: All your configurations in one place, from API keys to trading parameters.
-   `requirements.txt`: A list of necessary Python packages.
-   `pybithelp.md`: This file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All settings for the bot are managed in the `bot_config.yaml` file.

**API Keys:**
It is highly recommended to store your API keys as environment variables for security.

Set the following environment variables:
```
export BYBIT_API_KEY="YOUR_REAL_API_KEY"
export BYBIT_API_SECRET="YOUR_REAL_API_SECRET"
export BYBIT_USE_TESTNET="True"
```

The `main.py` script will automatically load these variables. Alternatively, you can set them directly in the `bot_config.yaml`.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Crafting Your Strategy

The `market_making_strategy.py` file contains the core trading logic. You can modify this file to implement your own custom strategies. The upgraded strategy now includes:

*   **Dynamic Spreads:** The bid/ask spread is now adjusted based on market volatility. Higher volatility will result in a wider spread to reduce risk.
*   **Inventory Skew:** The bot will adjust its quotes based on its current inventory. If the bot is long, it will skew its quotes to favor selling, and vice-versa.
*   **Stale Order Cancellation:** The bot will automatically cancel orders that have been open for a configurable amount of time.

## üöÄ Running the Bot

To unleash your bot, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Configure Your Bot**: Edit `bot_config.yaml` with your desired settings.

3.  **Start the Bot**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The bot will initialize, load your strategy, and start listening for market data to trade.

## üìù Logging

The bot creates a log file named `bybit_bot.log`. This file contains detailed information about the bot's activities, including signals, orders, and errors. Check this file to monitor the bot's performance and troubleshoot any issues.
