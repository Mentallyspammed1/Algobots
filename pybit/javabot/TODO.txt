# Project-Wide Improvements
## Security & Configuration
- [x] Ensure API keys are *never* hardcoded and are loaded securely (e.g., from environment variables or a secure vault).
- [x] Review all `DRY_RUN` flags and ensure they are set appropriately for production deployment.
- [ ] Standardize configuration loading across all bot versions (e.g., `config.js`, `config.json`, `config.yaml`).
    - [ ] Centralize all bot configuration into a single, well-defined structure (e.g., a `ConfigManager` class).
    - [ ] Implement dynamic fetching of `MIN_ORDER_SIZE`, `PRICE_PRECISION`, `QTY_PRECISION` from exchange info rather than hardcoding.
- [ ] Convert string-represented numbers in JSON/YAML configs to actual numbers during loading to prevent type issues.

## Codebase Structure & Maintainability
- [ ] Consolidate multiple bot versions (`wb*.js`, `ehlst.js`, `chanexit.js`, `market-maker.js`, `whale.js`, `unified_whalebot.js`) into a single, modular codebase.
    - [ ] Identify and remove redundant `.bak` files (`ehlst.bak.js`, `market-maker.bak.js`, `market-maker.bak1.js`).
    - [ ] Extract common utilities (logging, API interaction, math helpers) into shared modules.
    - [ ] Create a clear module structure for strategies, indicators, risk management, etc.
- [ ] Implement a consistent logging approach across all modules, potentially using a single logger instance.
- [ ] Review and update `package.json` dependencies for latest stable versions.
    - [ ] Run `npm audit` and `npm outdated` to identify and address dependency vulnerabilities and updates.
- [ ] Address truncated file content in `wb4.0.js` and `unified_whalebot.js` for full analysis.
- [ ] Break down overly large files/functions into smaller, single-responsibility modules/functions.
- [ ] Ensure consistent use of `Decimal.js` for all financial calculations to prevent floating-point inaccuracies.
- [ ] Standardize data structures used for kline data (e.g., always use `Decimal.js` for OHLCV values within kline objects).

## Error Handling & Robustness
- [ ] Enhance API error handling to be more specific than generic `catch` blocks. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff where appropriate.
    - [ ] Implement custom error types for specific API failures (e.g., rate limits, invalid parameters).
- [ ] Improve time synchronization robustness (as per previous context).
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker patterns for external API calls to prevent cascading failures.
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation for all external data (API responses, config values).
- [ ] Implement robust WebSocket reconnection and data integrity checks (e.g., handle missing kline data, out-of-order messages).
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of resources (e.g., database connections, WebSocket connections) on bot shutdown or error.

## Trading Logic & Strategy
- [ ] Refine signal generation logic across all strategies for consistency and performance.
- [ ] Improve precision and dynamic adjustment of Stop-Loss (SL) and Take-Profit (TP) orders.
    - [ ] Fetch price and quantity precision from exchange info dynamically.
- [ ] Review and standardize indicator implementations (e.g., remove "Mock" or "Placeholder" indicators in `indicators.js`).
- [ ] Implement a robust position reconciliation mechanism to ensure local state matches exchange state.
- [ ] Consider adding more advanced risk management features (e.g., daily loss limits, max drawdown, consecutive loss limits).
- [ ] Implement a unified position tracking and PnL management system across all bot instances.
- [ ] Explore implementing a backtesting framework to test strategies against historical data.

## Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Add comprehensive inline comments for complex logic, explaining *why* rather than *what*.
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components (indicator calculations, order placement, risk management).
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end trading flows.
- [ ] Document the overall architecture and how different modules interact.
- [ ] Implement input sanitization for any user-provided inputs (if applicable).
- [ ] Review all external dependencies for known vulnerabilities (`npm audit`).
