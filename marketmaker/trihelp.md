The provided code implements a market-making bot for the Bybit exchange, focusing on placing and managing limit orders to profit from the bid-ask spread. To improve its profitability, I suggest five enhancements, each addressing a specific aspect of the strategy. Below, I outline these improvements with explanations and code snippets where applicable.

---

### 1. **Dynamic Position Sizing Based on Volatility**
**Problem**: The current strategy uses a fixed order size (`base_order_size` from `config`) without adjusting for market volatility. In volatile markets, fixed sizes can lead to overexposure or insufficient liquidity provision, reducing profitability or increasing risk.

**Improvement**: Implement dynamic position sizing that adjusts order quantities based on recent market volatility. This can reduce risk during high volatility and increase exposure during stable conditions, optimizing the balance between risk and reward.

**Implementation**:
Add a method to calculate volatility and adjust order sizes in the `MarketMakingStrategy` class. Use the standard deviation of recent price changes as a volatility proxy.

```python
from statistics import stdev
from typing import Tuple

class MarketMakingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, config: Config, market_info: MarketInfo):
        self.config = config
        self.market_info = market_info

    def calculate_volatility(self, state: TradingState) -> float:
        """Calculate price volatility based on recent price changes."""
        if len(state.price_candlestick_history) < 2:
            return float(self.config.strategy.dynamic_spread.default_volatility)
        
        price_changes = [
            float((high - low) / low)
            for _, high, low, _ in state.price_candlestick_history
            if low != 0
        ]
        return stdev(price_changes) if price_changes else float(self.config.strategy.dynamic_spread.default_volatility)

    def get_target_orders(self, state: TradingState) -> Tuple[Decimal, Decimal, Decimal, Decimal]:
        """Adjust order sizes based on volatility."""
        volatility = self.calculate_volatility(state)
        volatility_factor = min(max(volatility / float(self.config.strategy.dynamic_spread.default_volatility), 0.5), 2.0)
        adjusted_order_size = self.config.strategy.base_order_size / Decimal(volatility_factor)

        mid_price = state.smoothed_mid_price
        spread = self.config.strategy.spread_pct * mid_price
        target_bid = mid_price - (spread / Decimal("2"))
        target_ask = mid_price + (spread / Decimal("2"))

        buy_qty = self.market_info.format_quantity(adjusted_order_size)
        sell_qty = self.market_info.format_quantity(adjusted_order_size)

        return target_bid, buy_qty, target_ask, sell_qty
```

**Explanation**:
- Calculate volatility using the standard deviation of relative price ranges (`(high - low) / low`) from the `price_candlestick_history`.
- Adjust the `base_order_size` inversely proportional to volatility (higher volatility reduces order size, and vice versa).
- Cap the volatility factor to prevent extreme adjustments (e.g., between 0.5x and 2x).
- This approach reduces exposure during volatile periods, preserving capital, and increases liquidity provision in stable markets to capture more spread.

---

### 2. **Incorporate Volume-Weighted Spread Adjustment**
**Problem**: The current spread is static (`spread_pct` in `config`), which may not adapt to market liquidity conditions. In low-liquidity markets, wider spreads are needed to mitigate risk, while in high-liquidity markets, tighter spreads can increase trade frequency.

**Improvement**: Adjust the spread dynamically based on order book volume or recent trade volume, allowing the bot to tighten spreads in liquid markets to compete better and widen them in illiquid markets to protect against adverse price movements.

**Implementation**:
Modify the `MarketMakingStrategy` to incorporate order book volume data from WebSocket updates.

```python
class MarketMakingStrategy:
    def get_orderbook_liquidity(self, state: TradingState, orderbook_data: dict) -> float:
        """Calculate liquidity based on order book volume within a price range."""
        if not orderbook_data.get("b") or not orderbook_data.get("a"):
            return 1.0  # Default liquidity factor
        bids = orderbook_data["b"]
        asks = orderbook_data["a"]
        mid_price = state.smoothed_mid_price
        price_range = mid_price * Decimal("0.01")  # Consider volume within 1% of mid-price
        bid_volume = sum(
            float(qty) for price, qty in bids if Decimal(price) >= mid_price - price_range
        )
        ask_volume = sum(
            float(qty) for price, qty in asks if Decimal(price) <= mid_price + price_range
        )
        total_volume = bid_volume + ask_volume
        return total_volume / float(self.config.strategy.base_order_size)  # Normalize to base order size

    def get_target_orders(self, state: TradingState, orderbook_data: dict = None) -> Tuple[Decimal, Decimal, Decimal, Decimal]:
        """Adjust spread based on order book liquidity."""
        liquidity_factor = self.get_orderbook_liquidity(state, orderbook_data or {})
        spread_adjustment = min(max(1.0 / liquidity_factor, 0.5), 2.0)  # Between 0.5x and 2x
        adjusted_spread = self.config.strategy.spread_pct * Decimal(spread_adjustment)

        mid_price = state.smoothed_mid_price
        target_bid = mid_price - (adjusted_spread * mid_price / Decimal("2"))
        target_ask = mid_price + (adjusted_spread * mid_price / Decimal("2"))

        buy_qty = self.market_info.format_quantity(self.config.strategy.base_order_size)
        sell_qty = self.market_info.format_quantity(self.config.strategy.base_order_size)

        return target_bid, buy_qty, target_ask, sell_qty
```

**Explanation**:
- Calculate liquidity by summing the volume of bids and asks within a 1% price range of the mid-price.
- Adjust the spread inversely to liquidity: high volume (liquid market) tightens the spread, low volume widens it.
- Update the `BybitMarketMaker` to pass the latest order book data to `get_target_orders` in the `_manage_orders` method:

```python
async def _manage_orders(self):
    # ... existing code ...
    latest_orderbook = None
    while not self.orderbook_queue.empty():
        latest_orderbook = await self.orderbook_queue.get()
    target_bid_price, buy_qty, target_ask_price, sell_qty = self.strategy.get_target_orders(self.state, latest_orderbook)
    # ... rest of the method ...
```

**Explanation**:
- This increases profitability by capturing more trades in liquid markets and reducing losses from wide price swings in illiquid markets.

### 3. **Advanced Fee Optimization with Post-Only Orders**
**Problem**: The bot uses a `post_only` flag but doesnâ€™t fully optimize for maker fees. If orders are filled as takers, higher fees reduce profitability.

**Improvement**: Enhance the order placement logic to prioritize post-only orders and monitor execution to cancel and replace orders that risk being filled as takers. Additionally, track maker vs. taker fees in metrics to evaluate fee efficiency.

**Implementation**:
Modify the `_place_limit_order` method to enforce post-only behavior and add fee tracking in `TradeMetrics`.

```python
class TradeMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing attributes ...
        self.maker_fees = Decimal("0")
        self.taker_fees = Decimal("0")

    def update_fee_metrics(self, fee: Decimal, liquidity_role: str):
        """Track maker vs taker fees."""
        if liquidity_role == "Maker":
            self.maker_fees += fee
        else:
            self.taker_fees += fee
        self.total_fees += fee

class BybitMarketMaker:
    async def _place_limit_order(self, side: str, price: Decimal, quantity: Decimal):
        # ... existing code ...
        params["timeInForce"] = "PostOnly"  # Enforce PostOnly
        try:
            result = await self.trading_client.place_order(params)
            if result and result.get("orderId"):
                oid = result["orderId"]
                self.logger.info(
                    f"Placed {side} post-only order: ID={oid}, Price={price_f}, Qty={qty_f}"
                )
                async with self.active_orders_lock:
                    self.state.active_orders[oid] = {
                        "side": side,
                        "price": price_f,
                        "qty": qty_f,
                        "cumExecQty": Decimal("0"),
                        "status": "New",
                        "orderLinkId": order_link_id,
                        "symbol": self.config.symbol,
                        "reduceOnly": params.get("reduceOnly", False),
                    }
                await self.db_manager.log_order_event(
                    {**params, "orderId": oid, "orderStatus": "New", "cumExecQty": "0"},
                    "Post-only order placed",
                )
            else:
                self.logger.warning(
                    f"Post-only order rejected for {side} at {price_f}. Retrying with adjusted price."
                )
                # Adjust price slightly and retry
                adjusted_price = price_f * (Decimal("0.999") if side == "Buy" else Decimal("1.001"))
                await self._place_limit_order(side, adjusted_price, qty_f)
        except BybitAPIError as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Failed to place post-only order: {e}")
            raise OrderPlacementError(f"Failed to place {side} post-only order.")

    async def _process_fill(self, trade_data: dict):
        # ... existing code ...
        liquidity_role = trade_data.get("execType", "Taker")
        self.state.metrics.update_fee_metrics(exec_fee, liquidity_role)
        self.logger.info(
            f"Fill processed: {side} {exec_qty} @ {exec_price}, Fee: {exec_fee} ({liquidity_role})"
        )
        # ... rest of the method ...
```

**Explanation**:
- Enforce `PostOnly` to ensure orders are added to the order book (maker fees are lower).
- If a post-only order is rejected, adjust the price slightly (e.g., 0.1% lower for buys, higher for sells) and retry.
- Track maker vs. taker fees in `TradeMetrics` to analyze fee efficiency in `_log_status_summary`:

```python
async def _log_status_summary(self):
    # ... existing code ...
    self.logger.info(
        f"STATUS | Total Current PNL: {total_current_pnl:+.4f} | {pnl_summary} | "
        f"Net Realized PNL: {metrics.net_realized_pnl:+.4f} | Daily PNL: {daily_pnl:+.4f} ({daily_loss_pct:.2%}) | "
        f"Win Rate: {metrics.win_rate:.2f}% | Position: {pos_qty} {self.config.base_currency} | "
        f"Fees: Maker {metrics.maker_fees:.4f}, Taker {metrics.taker_fees:.4f} | "
        f"Orders: {active_buys} Buy / {active_sells} Sell"
    )
```

**Explanation**:
- This reduces trading costs by maximizing maker fee usage, directly boosting net profitability.

### 4. **Inventory Skewing to Manage Position Risk**
**Problem**: The bot places symmetric bid and ask orders, which can lead to accumulating unwanted inventory (e.g., too long or short) in trending markets, increasing risk and reducing profitability.

**Improvement**: Implement inventory skewing to adjust bid and ask prices or quantities based on the current position. If the bot is long, favor sells by widening the bid spread or reducing bid quantity, and vice versa.

**Implementation**:
Add inventory skew logic to `MarketMakingStrategy`.

```python
class MarketMakingStrategy:
    def get_target_orders(self, state: TradingState, orderbook_data: dict = None) -> Tuple[Decimal, Decimal, Decimal, Decimal]:
        mid_price = state.smoothed_mid_price
        spread = self.config.strategy.spread_pct * mid_price
        
        # Inventory skew based on position
        position = state.current_position_qty
        max_position = self.config.strategy.max_position_size
        skew_factor = (
            Decimal("0.5") * (position / max_position)
            if max_position != 0
            else Decimal("0")
        )

        # Adjust spread: long position -> widen bid, tighten ask
        bid_spread_adjust = Decimal("1") + skew_factor
        ask_spread_adjust = Decimal("1") - skew_factor
        target_bid = mid_price - (spread * bid_spread_adjust / Decimal("2"))
        target_ask = mid_price + (spread * ask_spread_adjust / Decimal("2"))

        # Adjust quantities: reduce size on overexposed side
        base_qty = self.config.strategy.base_order_size
        buy_qty = base_qty * (Decimal("1") - skew_factor) if skew_factor > 0 else base_qty
        sell_qty = base_qty * (Decimal("1") + skew_factor) if skew_factor < 0 else base_qty

        buy_qty = self.market_info.format_quantity(buy_qty)
        sell_qty = self.market_info.format_quantity(sell_qty)

        self.logger.debug(
            f"Inventory skew: Position={position}, Skew factor={skew_factor}, "
            f"Bid spread adj={bid_spread_adjust}, Ask spread adj={ask_spread_adjust}"
        )
        return target_bid, buy_qty, target_ask, sell_qty
```

**Explanation**:
- Calculate a `skew_factor` based on the current position relative to a configured `max_position_size`.
- Widen the spread on the side of the current position (e.g., wider bid spread if long) and tighten the opposite side to encourage inventory reduction.
- Adjust quantities to place smaller orders on the overexposed side.
- Add `max_position_size` to `Config`:

```python
class Config:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing fields ...
        self.strategy.max_position_size = Decimal("1000")  # Example max position
```

**Explanation**:
- This reduces inventory risk in trending markets, improving profitability by avoiding large, unhedged positions.

---

### 5. **Profit-Taking Mechanism**
**Problem**: The bot lacks a mechanism to lock in profits when unrealized gains reach a certain threshold, which can lead to missed opportunities if the market reverses.

**Improvement**: Implement a profit-taking mechanism that places market orders to close positions when unrealized PnL exceeds a configured threshold, securing gains.

**Implementation**:
Add a profit-taking check in `_manage_orders` and a method to place market orders.

```python
class Config:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing fields ...
        self.strategy.profit_take_threshold = Decimal("0.02")  # 2% unrealized PnL threshold

class BybitMarketMaker:
    async def _place_market_order(self, side: str, quantity: Decimal):
        """Place a market order to take profit."""
        qty_f = self.market_info.format_quantity(quantity)
        if qty_f <= Decimal("0"):
            self.logger.warning(f"Invalid market order quantity: {qty_f}. Skipping.")
            return

        params = {
            "category": self.config.category,
            "symbol": self.config.symbol,
            "side": side,
            "orderType": "Market",
            "qty": str(qty_f),
            "reduceOnly": True,
        }
        if self.config.trading_mode in ["DRY_RUN", "SIMULATION"]:
            oid = f"DRY_MKT_{side}_{int(time.time() * 1000)}"
            self.logger.info(
                f"{self.config.trading_mode}: Would place market {side} order: Qty={qty_f}"
            )
            await self._process_fill({
                "orderId": oid,
                "symbol": self.config.symbol,
                "side": side,
                "execQty": str(qty_f),
                "execPrice": str(self.state.mid_price),
                "execFee": str(qty_f * self.state.mid_price * self.market_info.taker_fee_rate),
                "feeCurrency": self.config.quote_currency,
                "execType": "Taker",
            })
            return

        result = await self.trading_client.place_order(params)
        if result and result.get("orderId"):
            self.logger.info(f"Placed market {side} order: Qty={qty_f}")
        else:
            self.logger.error(f"Failed to place market {side} order: Qty={qty_f}")

    async def _manage_orders(self):
        # ... existing code ...
        unrealized_pnl = self.state.metrics.calculate_unrealized_pnl(self.state.mid_price)
        if abs(unrealized_pnl) > self.state.current_balance * self.config.strategy.profit_take_threshold:
            self.logger.info(f"Profit-taking triggered: Unrealized PnL={unrealized_pnl}")
            position_qty = self.state.metrics.current_asset_holdings
            if position_qty > 0:
                await self._place_market_order("Sell", position_qty)
            elif position_qty < 0:
                await self._place_market_order("Buy", -position_qty)
        else:
            await self._reconcile_and_place_orders(target_bid_price, buy_qty, target_ask_price, sell_qty)
```

**Explanation**:
- Check if unrealized PnL exceeds a threshold (e.g., 2% of current balance).
- Place a market order to close the position (reduce-only to avoid opening new positions).
- Handle dry-run/simulation modes by simulating fills at the current mid-price.
- This locks in profits during favorable market movements, increasing realized PnL.
