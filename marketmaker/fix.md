To suggest improvements for your market maker bot (`r1_0.py`), I'll base my recommendations on the log output, which indicates a market-making strategy in DRY_RUN mode for the `XLMUSDT` pair. The log shows frequent order cancellations, a lack of sell orders, and consistent but static PNL/position metrics. Since I don’t have the actual code, I’ll assume a typical market-making bot structure using Python with a trading API (e.g., similar to ccxt or a custom exchange API). The following five code snippets address potential issues and enhance the bot’s functionality:

1. **Implement Two-Sided Order Placement (Buy and Sell)**:
   The log shows only buy orders being placed. To provide liquidity on both sides, add logic to place sell orders alongside buy orders to capture the bid-ask spread.

   ```python
   async def place_market_making_orders(self, symbol, target_bid, target_ask, order_qty):
       try:
           # Place Buy order
           buy_price = target_bid
           buy_order = {
               'symbol': symbol,
               'side': 'Buy',
               'price': buy_price,
               'quantity': order_qty,
               'order_id': f'DRY_Buy_{int(time.time() * 1000)}'
           }
           logging.info(f"DRY_RUN: Would place Buy order: ID={buy_order['order_id']}, Qty={order_qty}, Price={buy_price}")
           # Simulate placing buy order in DRY_RUN
           self.active_orders.append(buy_order)

           # Place Sell order
           sell_price = target_ask
           sell_order = {
               'symbol': symbol,
               'side': 'Sell',
               'price': sell_price,
               'quantity': order_qty,
               'order_id': f'DRY_Sell_{int(time.time() * 1000)}'
           }
           logging.info(f"DRY_RUN: Would place Sell order: ID={sell_order['order_id']}, Qty={order_qty}, Price={sell_price}")
           self.active_orders.append(sell_order)
       except Exception as e:
           logging.error(f"Error placing orders: {e}")
   ```

   **Why?** This ensures the bot places both buy and sell orders to maintain a balanced market-making strategy, addressing the absence of sell orders in the log.

2. **Reduce Excessive Order Cancellations**:
   The log shows frequent cancellations (every 5–10 seconds). Add a threshold to prevent canceling orders unless the price deviation exceeds a minimum value, reducing unnecessary churn.

   ```python
   def should_cancel_order(self, order, target_bid, target_ask, min_price_deviation=0.0001):
       order_price = Decimal(str(order['price']))
       order_side = order['side']
       if order_side == 'Buy':
           return abs(order_price - Decimal(str(target_bid))) > Decimal(str(min_price_deviation))
       elif order_side == 'Sell':
           return abs(order_price - Decimal(str(target_ask))) > Decimal(str(min_price_deviation))
       return False

   async def manage_orders(self, symbol, target_bid, target_ask, order_qty):
       for order in self.active_orders[:]:
           if self.should_cancel_order(order, target_bid, target_ask):
               logging.info(f"Cancelling stale/duplicate order {order['order_id']} (Side: {order['side']}, Price: {order['price']})")
               logging.info(f"DRY_RUN: Would cancel order {order['order_id']}.")
               self.active_orders.remove(order)
       await self.place_market_making_orders(symbol, target_bid, target_ask, order_qty)
   ```

   **Why?** Adding a `min_price_deviation` threshold (e.g., 0.0001) prevents cancellations for minor price changes, reducing simulated fees and improving efficiency.

3. **Dynamic Order Quantity Adjustment**:
   The log shows fixed quantities (499 or 500). Adjust order quantities based on market conditions or account balance to optimize exposure.

   ```python
   def calculate_order_quantity(self, balance, price, target_exposure_ratio=0.1):
       # Calculate quantity based on a percentage of available balance
       target_value = balance * target_exposure_ratio
       quantity = target_value / price
       # Round to meet exchange's quantity precision
       quantity_precision = self.market_info['quantity_precision']
       quantity = round(quantity, int(-quantity_precision.log10()))
       return max(quantity, self.market_info['min_order_qty'])

   async def place_dynamic_order(self, symbol, target_bid, target_ask):
       balance = self.get_virtual_balance()  # Simulated balance in DRY_RUN
       order_qty = self.calculate_order_quantity(balance, target_bid)
       logging.info(f"Calculated order quantity: {order_qty} for price {target_bid}")
       await self.place_market_making_orders(symbol, target_bid, target_ask, order_qty)
   ```

   **Why?** Dynamic quantities based on balance and price ensure the bot adapts to market conditions and maintains controlled exposure, especially when scaling to live trading.

4. **Handle Missing Fee Rates Robustly**:
   The log shows warnings for missing `makerFeeRate` and `takerFeeRate`. Add a fallback to fetch fee rates from the exchange API if available.

   ```python
   async def fetch_fee_rates(self, symbol):
       try:
           # Simulate fetching fee rates (replace with actual exchange API call)
           fee_data = {'makerFeeRate': '0.0002', 'takerFeeRate': '0.0005'}  # Example
           maker_fee = Decimal(fee_data.get('makerFeeRate', '0.0002'))
           taker_fee = Decimal(fee_data.get('takerFeeRate', '0.0005'))
           logging.info(f"Fetched fee rates for {symbol}: Maker={maker_fee}, Taker={taker_fee}")
           return maker_fee, taker_fee
       except Exception as e:
           logging.warning(f"Failed to fetch fee rates for {symbol}. Using defaults: Maker=0.0002, Taker=0.0005. Error: {e}")
           return Decimal('0.0002'), Decimal('0.0005')

   async def initialize_market_info(self, symbol):
       self.market_info = await self.fetch_market_info(symbol)
       maker_fee, taker_fee = await self.fetch_fee_rates(symbol)
       self.market_info['maker_fee_rate'] = maker_fee
       self.market_info['taker_fee_rate'] = taker_fee
   ```

   **Why?** Fetching fee rates dynamically reduces reliance on hardcoded defaults and ensures accurate PNL calculations, especially in live mode.

5. **Enhanced Status Reporting with Market Context**:
   The status updates are useful but lack market context (e.g., current bid/ask spread). Enhance reporting to include this information for better monitoring.

   ```python
   async def log_status(self, symbol, target_bid, target_ask):
       current_pnl = self.calculate_total_pnl()
       realized_pnl = self.trade_metrics['realized_pnl']
       unrealized_pnl = current_pnl - realized_pnl
       win_rate = self.trade_metrics['win_rate']
       position = self.trade_metrics['current_asset_holdings']
       exposure = position * target_bid
       spread = target_ask - target_bid
       logging.info(
           f"STATUS | Total Current PNL: {current_pnl:.4f} | Realized PNL: {realized_pnl:.4f} USDT | "
           f"Unrealized PNL: {unrealized_pnl:.4f} USDT | Net Realized PNL: {current_pnl:.4f} | "
           f"Win Rate: {win_rate:.2f}% | Position: {position} XLM (Exposure: {exposure:.2f} USDT) | "
           f"Orders: {sum(1 for o in self.active_orders if o['side'] == 'Buy')} Buy / "
           f"{sum(1 for o in self.active_orders if o['side'] == 'Sell')} Sell | "
           f"Market Spread: {spread:.5f}"
       )
   ```

   **Why?** Adding market spread and detailed order counts provides better insight into the bot’s performance and market conditions, aiding debugging and strategy tuning.

### Assumptions and Notes
- **Assumptions**: I assumed your bot uses a structure with async methods, a database for state, and a market-making strategy aiming to place orders around the bid-ask spread. The snippets use `Decimal` for precision, as seen in the log, and assume an `active_orders` list and `trade_metrics` dictionary for state management.
- **Integration**: These snippets are modular but may need integration into your existing code. Replace placeholder API calls (e.g., `fetch_market_info`) with your exchange’s API (e.g., ccxt or a custom client).
- **Testing**: Test these changes in DRY_RUN mode first to ensure they align with your strategy. Adjust parameters like `min_price_deviation` or `target_exposure_ratio` based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure you have `decimal`, `logging`, and `time` modules imported. If using an exchange API like ccxt, include it for live mode.

If you can share the actual `r1_0.py` code or specify details about the exchange, strategy, or desired improvements, I can tailor these snippets further. Let me know if you want help integrating them or have specific areas to focus on!
