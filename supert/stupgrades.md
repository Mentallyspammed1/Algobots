Here are 15 JSON code snippets, each proposing an improvement to the scalping strategy and potential profitability within the provided `stnew.py` framework. Each snippet includes a `name`, `description`, `config_params` (representing new or modified settings), and an `integration_point` indicating where in the existing code the feature would conceptually be implemented.

These snippets are designed to be integrated into the `Config` class or used as parameters for new or modified functions within the `EhlersSuperTrendBot`.

    "description": "Adjusts Take Profit level dynamically based on Average True Range (ATR), making TP adaptive to market volatility for better scalping. If the market is more volatile, the TP target will be larger, and vice versa. This helps capture more profit in trending conditions and reduces over-ambition in quieter markets.",
