# TODO.txt for /home/user/Algobots/Ob.py

## File Overview
`Ob.py` implements a trading bot named "Pyrmethus" that analyzes order book imbalance and Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) to generate trading signals. It uses `ccxt` for Bybit API interaction and features a "narrated" output style. This version appears to be a simplified or earlier iteration compared to `Obv1.py`, with hardcoded configuration and lacking backtesting capabilities.

## Key Components & Code Snippets

### Configuration
```python
# Constants
API_KEY = os.getenv('BYBIT_API_KEY')
API_SECRET = os.getenv('BYBIT_API_SECRET')
# ... other hardcoded parameters
```
-   **Task**: Externalize all configuration parameters into a `config.yaml` file, similar to `Obv1.py`, to allow for easier modification and management without altering the code.
-   **Task**: Implement robust validation for configuration parameters (e.g., `stop_loss_percentage`, `take_profit_percentage` should be positive floats).
-   **Test Suggestion**: Write unit tests for configuration loading (once externalized) to ensure defaults are applied and overrides work correctly.

### Pyrmethus Class & Narration
```python
class Pyrmethus:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_secret):
        # ...
    def narrate(self, message, color=Fore.WHITE):
        """Prints a message to the console, narrated by Pyrmethus."""
        # ...
```
-   **Task**: Integrate Python's standard `logging` module more deeply with the `narrate` function, allowing for different log levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR) and more flexible log output.
-   **Test Suggestion**: Write a test for the `narrate` function to ensure messages are correctly formatted and logged.

### API Interaction (`fetch_order_book`, `calculate_position_size`, `place_order`, `close_position`, `cancel_order`, `get_open_orders`)
```python
    def fetch_order_book(self, symbol):
        # ...
    def place_order(self, symbol, side, order_type, qty, price=None, stop_loss_price=None, take_profit_price=None):
        # ...
```
-   **Task**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for all `ccxt` API calls to handle transient network issues and rate limits.
-   **Task**: Ensure all financial calculations use `Decimal` for precision instead of `float` (e.g., in `calculate_position_size`, `place_order`).
-   **Task**: Refine `place_order` to handle order precision (price and quantity) dynamically based on exchange rules.
-   **Test Suggestion**: Mock `self.exchange` methods (e.g., `fetch_order_book`, `fetch_balance`, `fetch_ticker`, `create_order`, `fetch_positions`, `cancel_order`, `fetch_open_orders`) and write unit tests for each API interaction function to verify:
    *   Correct parameter passing.
    *   Proper handling of successful and error responses (e.g., `ccxt.NetworkError`, `ccxt.ExchangeError`, `ccxt.InsufficientFunds`).

### Order Book Analysis (`calculate_vwap`, `analyze_order_book`)
```python
    def calculate_vwap(self, orders, depth):
        # ...
    def analyze_order_book(self, order_book, depth=10):
        # ...
```
-   **Task**: Enhance `analyze_order_book` to consider different depths of the order book or weighted averages of bids/asks for more nuanced analysis.
-   **Task**: Implement a real-time order book update mechanism using WebSockets instead of polling via REST API for `fetch_order_book`.
-   **Test Suggestion**: Write unit tests for `calculate_vwap` with various order lists and depths.
-   **Test Suggestion**: Write unit tests for `analyze_order_book` with various order book structures (including empty or malformed) to verify correct calculations and error handling.

### Signal Generation (`generate_signals`)
```python
    def generate_signals(self, analysis):
        """Generates trading signals based on order book analysis."""
        # ...
```
-   **Task**: Refine the signal generation logic to incorporate more dynamic thresholds for VWAP and order book ratio, possibly adapting to market volatility.
-   **Task**: Add a cooldown mechanism to prevent rapid, successive trades based on fleeting signals.
-   **Test Suggestion**: Write unit tests for `generate_signals` with various `analysis` inputs to test different market conditions and ensure correct signal output (`long`, `short`, `hold`).

### Main Execution Flow (`main` method in `Pyrmethus` class, and top-level `main` function)
```python
    def main(self, symbol):
        # ...
def main():
    # ...
```
-   **Task**: Implement state persistence for the bot (e.g., `position`, trade history) to allow for seamless restarts.
-   **Task**: Add a graceful shutdown mechanism to ensure all open positions are managed before exiting.
-   **Task**: Implement backtesting functionality, similar to `Obv1.py`, to allow for strategy validation.
-   **Test Suggestion**: Write an integration test for the `main` function that mocks API calls and simulates market data to verify the end-to-end flow of the bot.

## General Improvements
-   **Type Hinting**: Add comprehensive type hints to all functions and methods.
-   **Docstrings**: Add or improve docstrings for all functions and classes.
-   **Modularity**: Consider further separating concerns (e.g., API interaction, order book analysis, signal generation) into distinct modules or classes.
-   **Error Handling**: Improve error handling throughout the bot to provide more informative messages and prevent crashes.
-   **Consolidation**: Evaluate if `Ob.py` and `Obv1.py` can be consolidated into a single, more robust and configurable bot.
